# Twitter: A UI Design Student's story of a love/hate relationship with Twitter

###I love you

In the Iron Yard application, they ask for your Twitter page. Immediately I rushed to my browser, attempted a login to my page to recall just exactly what a prospective school would find about me there. Two years, almost 2 years since my last tweet, and mostly just back and forth bantering with friends. 
	
Thankfully this lack of tweet/retweet/follow activity didn’t have a huge impact on me getting accepted to start my journey for a new career with the Iron Yard. Shortly after that first re-login, I slowly started to close the gap of last logins. I had been following news channels of all biases, my favorite non-profits, comedians, actors, Austin entertainment, the list goes on and on. I began to scroll and scroll and scroll, reading articles about the New York prison escapees, learning of great Austin events I had missed over the weekend, seeing Jeremy Piven politely respond to critics, and all this of my various interests from one webpage.
	
To add to what I had re-discovered, almost daily in lecture we are introduced to a new UI design language, reference site, and/or designer. I get to follow all of these amazing designers and sites and now get the most up to date, industry information as I learn for my new career in design! How cool. Twitter is great. Man, I love Twitter.
	
All was great with me and Twitter. And then Sam, our wonderful design instructor, assigned our weekend 2 project: recreating The Iron Yard's static Twitter page with vanilla HTML and CSS…
	
###I love you not

Why do you have all these tiny, little images and details, Twitter? Does it really make that much of a difference to throw small icon links after every tweet for different options on how to share, or retweet, or star?? Is it really that necessary to list everyone's Twitter handle after their Twitter name, and in a lighter, grey font??? That just creates so much more code, so many more classes. Ugh.
	
Why does everything I create on my page stop 300px down when I don't have a fixed height anywhere on the container?  I guess I'll just set a fixed height on the container that will surely cover the length of the page for now. There, that works. 
	
Why won't those divs float below each other?? I guess I can troubleshoot and hack it up with some absolute positioning. Ok, not perfect code, but it works.
	
Why won't all of these Trend links work??? Oh, there's a missing equals sign on all of them, duh…ok, I can fix that. 
	
Come Sunday evening, my Iron Yard Twitter recreation didn't look so bad. I was able to code it fairly close to the real thing without pulling _all_ of my hair out. Phew. OK, maybe you're not all that bad Twitter.
	
###I love you

At least that was short lived, right Twitter? One awful weekend together, sorting through every last detail of your code, but we can leave that in the past and go back to all the great things we had together before last weekend, for now. 
	
I do know that another petal, our next "I love you not," is looming in our future, waiting to be plucked in the coming weeks. Will it be for adding Sass to my Twitter code (ahhh)? Or worse, recreating Twitter's responsiveness?? Only time will tell.
	
Don't worry Twitter. I'm confident another petal will be plucked after our next downfall with Sass or responsiveness. I don't think Sam could completely ruin you for me (I don't think…).
