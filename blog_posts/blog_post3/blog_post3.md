#Exploring Typography with Baby A's

######June 25th, 2015

After much initial frustration attempting to create five different typography styles with TypeCast, a free online tool that happens to be super glitchy (not saving work, etc.), I finally left hours of work and started over in Photoshop. With my slight experience in Photoshop from learning how to make style tiles, I found this process much more successful.

Although I was more comfortable being able to produce options in Photoshop, I still really struggled with giving each version a concept (hence the numbered list). I did attempt at creating a "concept list" before I even started looking at types. Here's a quick snapshot of what I came up with.

I got to these "concepts" from my word list about Baby A's by basically pulling together key words that seemed to fit together and creating different "feels" for Baby A's. Hearing other classmates examples of their concepts, I'm not quite sure I got them down correctly. With the small timeframe of one evening to throw all of these together, I simply decided to attack the type and see what I could come up with, links below for your viewing pleasure.

I'm excited to head into class this morning to get feedback on both how I conceptualized the concepts (see what I did there?) and how my different type versions would actually fit with the restaurant website redesign of Baby A's. I should (should . . . ) have a three-page website by Monday with the option I choose!
