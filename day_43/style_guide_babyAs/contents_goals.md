##Goals

Baby Acapulco's, or Baby A's, is a local tex-mex staple in Austin, surpassing 30 years as a family friendly restaurant with 5 convenient locations. Their fruity drinks, or "celebrities", are famous attractions, as well as their giant bowls of queso and delicious tortilla soup. Diners range from Austinites, to travelers, to families, to college students, and so on and so on. Baby A's has undergone many menu, logo and restaurant designs over the years.

A couple of challenges Baby A's faces with their current website include:

- All content outside of navigation on the site within gif format, constraining readability to visual only
- All content is not responsive to multiple devices based on gif format, causing difficulty of viewing content across devices smaller the gif size

The main goals of the redesign project are to address those two challenges in a refreshing style that also emulates the bold and casual environment of Baby Acapulco's.
