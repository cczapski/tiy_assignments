		<!-- GOALS -->
			<div>
				<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
				<p>Baby Acapulco's, or Baby A's, is a local tex-mex staple in Austin, surpassing 30 years as a family friendly restaurant with 5 convenient locations. Their fruity drinks, or "celebrities", are famous attractions, as well as their giant bowls of queso and delicious tortilla soup. Diners range from Austinites, to travelers, to families, to college students, virtually to almost any variety of patron. Baby A's has undergone many menu, logo and restaurant designs over the years.</p>
				<p>With the almost daily increase in Austin's population (check out Forbes' prediction of Austin with the highest projected economic growth rate in the US from 2011 - 2016 <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlj45hfdf/1-austin-texas/">here</a>) also comes a dramatic increase in the number of new restaurants entering an already populated market. Against this sea of new choices for dining, Baby A's faces the challenges of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Retaining it's existing customer base</li>
					<li>Attracting the new Austin community</li>
					<li>Standing out to travelers and tourists as a worthy choice for dining</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This website redesign project centers around addressing the current market challenges and focuses on two key website structure adjustments detailed below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Updating all content on the site to exist outside of gif files for ease in readibility and accessibility extending past only visual access</li>
					<li>Updating the responsive ability across all aspects of the site for optimum viewing on any device</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With these adjustments, the new design will maintain a refreshing style that emulates the bold and casual environment of the existing Baby Acapulco's.</p>

		<!-- TYPOGRAPHY -->
			<div>
				<h2 id="type">Typography</h2>
				<p>FF Enzo by FontFont through Adobe Typekit is the single typeface used in the redesign. This type was chosen in order to create a more modern and fun feel to the website with its san-serif and small, human-like characteristics. FF Enzo is also very versatile with its various weights and styles, providing the ability for variation in a single typeface.</p>

		<!-- COLORS -->
			<div>
				<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>
				<p>All of the Baby A's restaurants have their own slight variation in vibrance of color, but always bold, with commonalities in purple, pink, blue and green. For this reason, the colors selected for the redesign center around these four colors, with bright and bold versions that help remind one of the bright colorful "celebrities," or fruity drinks, that Baby A's is known for.</p>
