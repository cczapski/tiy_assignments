# Content Process

## Content Cataloging

Once I narrowed down my 4 pages for the project, I started cataloging all of the content that is currently on the website for the main pages. Below are links to each markdown file with that content.

* [Home](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/content/content_home.md)
* [For Future + Current Volunteers](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/content/content_volunteers.md)
* [Choose Your Destination](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/content/content_destinations.md)
* [Country Page - Costa Rica](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/content/content_country_page.md)

## Paper Prototyping

From there, I started paper prototyping with the Country Page. I chose the Country Page because it has the most content (an overwhelmingly large amount) and I knew it would be the most difficult to create the most effective layout and structure. 

This photo is the first paper prototype of the Country Page for Costa Rica. This version includes all of the information about the country that is currently available.

This second photo is version 2 of the paper prototype for the most content heavy page. The main difference is condensing each of the four sections (Country Details, Day in the Life, Year Long Service, Summer Service) into quick, important blurbs and moving the heart of the content to individual pages for each. Based on the limitations of the project, I will not be building out those pages for this first phase.
