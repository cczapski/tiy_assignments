##Quick Intro to Users on Purpose of Survey

###Family

Dearest family,

As most of you know, I'm in a UI (web) design course and I am currently starting my final project. For this final project, I will be redesigning the WorldTeach website, which is also the non-profit organization through which I spent my year abroad in Costa Rica teaching English.

I'm requesting your assistance to aid in creating the most effective design. Can you take 10 - 15 minutes to review the existing website and answer questions from your point of view about the website?

I promise to repay your time and insight with my great company, and possibly a beverage or two (or perhaps some fresh pierogis are more towards your preference...I'm open to discussing options).

Time is of the essence, as I have two short weeks to complete this redesign, and this research portion is only the beginning. If you're able to complete by tomorrow evening, it would be most helpful.

I appreciate any help you can provide!
