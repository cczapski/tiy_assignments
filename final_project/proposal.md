* What is the length of the volunteer program?
* Does the organization align with my personal values, goals, and/or expectations for volunteering abroad?
* Is there any experience or qualification requirements for the program(s), and if so, do I meet those?
* What is the before, during and after program support from the organization like?
    * Who is my main point of contact for all preparation for the trip?
    * Who is my main point of contact during the trip, and for any emergencies while in country?
* How do you place volunteers in their locations?
* What happens if I want to leave my placement?
* Is the organization well-established?
* Can I trust and rely on international travel through this organization?
* Does the organization provide volunteer training and resources before, during and after the program?
* What are the locations for volunteering?
* What is the language in the locations for volunteering?
* What is the cost to volunteer, and where is that money going (i.e. room and board, food, insurance, travel, organizational expenses)?
* Can I speak with past volunteers in the program?
* What do reviews say?
* Do I have any special needs that must be met while abroad (i.e. food, medical)?
