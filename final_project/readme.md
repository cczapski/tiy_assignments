## History & Intro 
WorldTeach is a non-profit organization that pairs volunteers with partner countries throughout the world to teach for summer, semester, and year-long teaching sessions that cater towards the needs of the local community and promote responsible global citizenship.

WorldTeach's volunteer teach abroad programs are the only of their kind open to adults with no education background that offer the level of commitment and time towards promoting cross-cultural social responsibility in education.

###What is most important to them in a volunteer program?

Personal preferences on country, language of country, price, etc. will all vary on the specific volunteer. Below are some of the most common questions that users exploring education-focused volunteer abroad programs will ask themselves when deciding on a program to choose from (in no particular order). 

* What is the length of the volunteer program?
* Does the organization align with my personal values, goals, and/or expectations for volunteering abroad?
* Is there any experience or qualification requirements for the program(s), and if so, do I meet those?
* What is the before, during and after program support from the organization like?
    * Who is my main point of contact for all preparation for the trip?
    * Who is my main point of contact during the trip, and for any emergencies while in country?
* How do you place volunteers in their locations?
* What happens if I want to leave my placement?
* Is the organization well-established?
* Can I trust and rely on international travel through this organization?
* Does the organization provide volunteer training and resources before, during and after the program?
* What are the locations for volunteering?
* What is the language in the locations for volunteering?
* What is the cost to volunteer, and where is that money going (i.e. room and board, food, insurance, travel, organizational expenses)?
* Can I speak with past volunteers in the program?
* What do reviews say?
* Do I have any special needs that must be met while abroad (i.e. food, medical)?

## Research and Discovery

The majority of the proposal details out key elements of the research and discovery phase. This section links to additional elements of the research and discovery phase.

* [User Interviews](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/research/user_interviews.md)
* [Site Map and Content Analysis Planning](https://github.com/cczapski/tiy_assignments/blob/master/final_project/sitemap.md)

## Competitive Market Study

Any Google search for volunteer abroad opens up a world of seemingly endless opportunities. With that range of endless opportunties also comes a range of volunteer types, locations, missions and overall purposes. WorldTeach has a dedicated focus for teaching in 3 to 12 month durations across 15+ countries for any individual meeting 3 minimum requirements. 

Main competitors in this market study focus on organizations that have similar core purposes surrounding education in developing locations. Competitors outside of WorldTeach's more focused scope (i.e. organizations with limited volunteer locations, with various types of volunteer opportunities or with more strict volunteer qualifications for teaching) are listed as Other Competitors.

### Main Competitors

* [Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov/)
* [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/)

### Other Competitors

* [International Service Learning](http://www.islonline.org/enrichment-programs/education/)

* [Love Volunteers](http://www.lovevolunteers.org/)
* [Volunteer HQ](https://www.volunteerhq.org)
* [Cross Cultural Solutions](http://www.crossculturalsolutions.org/)

### What are their strengths?

* Well established names and brand identities
* More variety in time commitments (i.e. 1 week to 24 weeks)
* Larger variety in locations to travel
* Higher number of volunteers placed each year

### What are their weaknesses?

* More specific personal experience and background requirements
* More thorough application process
* Less focused mission with multiple volunteer types outside of education

### How does WorldTeach stand out against these competitors?

* Single, targeted focus on education abroad for any American that meets 3 basic requirements
* Almost 30 years experience
* Specific and selective application process for placement in countries
* Thorough information surrounding entire process
* Choice in placement location
