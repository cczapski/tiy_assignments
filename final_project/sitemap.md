## Content & Organizational Observations

From an analysis of WorldTeach's content, here are key conclusions:

* A LOT of content
* A LOT of links to get to different areas of the site
* The actual site mapping done by WorldTeach on their website isn't consistent with everything displayed on their website
* I didn't even notice there was a subnavigation to the main nav on the pages where this exists until I was working through their site map and wondering where do you get to all of these pages on the site
* There is repetitive information throughout the site
* Segmentation of content is not intuitive through navigation and subnavigation menus
