##### Featured "Day in the Life" article

##### La Violeta, by Erin Vinacco, CR Year 2011
 
###### Host Community
La Violeta is a small coffee farming town in the mountains of central Costa Rica home to about 300 people. The main source of employment is farming and picking coffee though more young people are starting to go to high school in nearby towns so that may change in the years to come. There’s another larger town nearby that has everything a gringa could need (photocopies/internet/grocery store/post office etc.) Most people who live here are related in some way, though I still have no idea how. Everyone knows everyone and while I still have no idea of peoples names because we’ve never been formally introduced everyone “knows” me and will shout “Hola Teacher!” wherever I go. It takes a bit getting used to living in a small town but I’ve grown to prefer the familiarity of this life to the anonymity of the city. I’ve felt really welcome here from the beginning. There will always be some people that are not as open but as a whole the community is extremely accepting of having a foreigner here. They’re curious about my culture and where I’m from as well as grateful that their children are getting such a great English education. One of my favorite things to do here is visit families for coffee or go for a walk and take in the breath-taking green mountains that surround us. It is a truly beautiful and “traquilo” place to live.  

###### Teaching Assignment
Teaching has definitely been one of the highlights of my life here. I knew I loved teaching before coming here and had some experience working in elementary schools. However, learning to teach English as a foreign language in a foreign country has its own challenges. I have about 36 students (which is a lot compared to some sites that have only 12!) in grades first through sixth and ideally I see each class for 40 minutes a day. But as one quickly learns, schedules, if you are lucky enough to receive one, are subject to change at ANY moment. Yes, that means anywhere from 5 minutes before class to 10 minutes into class. And there’s a definite lack of discipline in the school in general so you might be the only one with crazy rules like “raise your hand” and “don’t leave the classroom without permission” or “no yelling.” Go with the flow is not a motto it’s a necessity if you want to keep your sanity.

There are lots of “acto civicos” which are like little assemblies that happen every time there’s a special day to celebrate (arbor day, labor day etc.) and school can get canceled a lot when the classroom teacher has meetings which is just part of working in a really small school. In my school there is one other teacher in addition to the director (principal) of the school and they each teach three grades. Students only come for half days of school and they rotate coming in the morning and in the afternoon from one week to the next.   The class sizes are small with the average class size being about 5 or 6 students but all of this varies depending on your site. I’m fortunate enough to have one of the more regular schedules and a good deal of resources accumulated after 11 years of the World Teach program in my town. It’s certainly not the easiest job but it has its perks and even if you decide you don’t like teaching you’ll still learn a lot about how to be creative and flexible. Planning is essential but you also have to be willing to throw it in the trash or completely reinvent on the spot depending on any number of unexpected circumstances. Oh and of course the kids are great. They’re kids so there are days when I have less patience but at the end of the day I love them.

###### Living Arrangement
I live with a host family in my town and its definitely another highlight of the program here in Costa Rica. I love my family and have come to see this as my home away from home. Though lack of privacy, cold showers, insects and critters and the monotony of rice and beans can get a girl down sometimes I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything. Since I live and teach here I end up seeing a lot of my students outside of school.  We’ve gone on vacation together, celebrated births, deaths, weddings and holidays. It’s a unique experience and one that has really taught me to appreciate community on a whole new level. Also living with a family has been the best way of improving my language skills. 

###### Language Issues
I arrived here with only a few weeks of adult education Spanish under my belt and got two more weeks of review during orientation. Not a great starting place. While I can now safely say it’s not impossible to learn Spanish this way I certainly can’t recommend it. Probably my greatest source of frustration, confusion, disappointment and loneliness came from my lack of language skills. It’s also a very humbling experience to have no idea what’s going on a regular basis.   People speak pretty quickly here and in rural areas they have lots of “dichos” or sayings and unique words they use that I still haven’t quite mastered. There seems to be an endless number of words for every little thing and I don’t think I’ll ever perfect my masculine and feminine articles. With all that said, I loved learning Spanish while talking to people about real life issues, things that are important to us on a day to day basis. Sure beats any four-wall classroom. My abilities fluctuate; there are still some things I can’t quite explain and at least once I day I find myself grasping for the right word. But there is nothing quite like the joy of conversing with someone in their native language and making a real connection.

###### Greatest Challenges
The best advice is to try not to have to many expectations. Easier said than done. 

Spanish was probably the greatest challenge but even as I started to understand more of what’s going there are been cultural misunderstandings as well. Coming from a culture that prides itself on productivity, efficiency and accomplishment it’s sometimes difficult to know how to operate within a school system that’s so tranquilo. Also it’s not always easy to be flexible when it comes to “schedules” and plans. One quickly learns that “ahora” which supposedly means “now” actually means anywhere from “in 5 minutes” to “tomorrow” or longer. I think the hardest thing for me is to know how share my culture and values while keeping in mind that there’s no right and wrong. Also some people find living in a small town boring but I like it and with classes canceled regularly you can always get away for a long weekend when you need to.

###### Greatest rewards
Learning and community. Coffee and tortillas. My students and my family. The beautiful views and fresh air. I know I’m here to teach but honestly I am so incredibly grateful for everything I’ve learned and will continue to learn. So many people have been so generous with their food, their time, their knowledge and their kindness. Living here has taught me so much about community, culture and family. It’s given me so many opportunities to grow and change by confronting my own cultural biases and learn new ways of living. While my American upbringing taught me to be motivated and work hard to achieve, here in Costa Rica I’ve learned the importance of generosity, gratitude for the simple things and most importantly how to listen and learn from every experience and every person.

* Additional volunteer requirements: holding a bachelor's degree at the time of departure
* TEFL Certification: eligible to complete during service (except for bilingual placements)
* Number of volunteers each year: approximately 20
* Monthly stipend: yes
* Orientation: 1 month
* Students: grades 1st through 6th
* Teaching: English (and in limited bilingual placements, math and science)

###### Your Role as a Volunteer
Your service in Costa Rica will begin with a nearly month-long intensive orientation run by the Field Staff. Orientation will include TEFL training, one week of intensive practice teaching, Spanish classes, information sessions and discussions about Costa Rican culture and politics, health and safety issues, and cross-cultural adjustment.

After orientation, volunteers travel to their sites and begin their teaching assignments. As a year long WorldTeach volunteer in Costa Rica you will serve as a full-time teacher at a public elementary school spending about 20 hours a week in the classroom.  You will teach English to first through sixth grades. The schools are generally small, and you are likely to be the only English teacher in a total school staff of 1-8 teachers. The School Director will be your direct supervisor. 

Apart from classroom hours your responsibilities will include lesson planning, creating and grading homework and exams, and attending parent and school staff meetings. Students' English level is generally low and varies greatly between communities and even among students in the same school and grade. 

Many WorldTeach Costa Rica volunteers start or contribute to community projects in addition to their regular teaching responsibilities. The projects that volunteers pursue in their communities depend on local needs, as well as volunteer talents and interests. Some examples of past projects include adult classes, English clubs for informal practice, developing environmental education or conservation projects, arranging sport or drama activities, and developing a small English library.

###### Special Bilingual School Placements
Each year we place 1-2 volunteers at each of the bilingual schools. The bilingual schools are located in the larger and more touristic communities of Manuel Antonio and Zeta Trece (near La Fortuna). Volunteers at these schools work with larger school staffs and with many students (200-400 students in each school). Each school has local English teachers so the volunteers share the teaching load and sometimes co-teach and co-plan with their local counterparts. Volunteers normally teach English as a Foreign Language and/or science. We ask those interested in these placements to apply to them specifically.

###### TEFL Eligibility + Fees
The Costa Rica program provides TEFL Certification throughout your 11 months as a volunteer. Bilingual school placements are not eligible based on the focus of their teaching not solely with the English language. 

Enrollment Fee: $350

###### Placements + Housing
Volunteers in the year long program are placed throughout the seven provinces of the country and placements are individual. The bus system is well established however, so most volunteers won't be more than a two to three hour bus ride from another volunteer.

All volunteers live with local Costa Rican families who receive compensation from the Ministry of Education for providing volunteers with food and lodging. Most volunteers have their own room and share the bathroom and living space with their host family. While most homes have hot water and a telephone, some may not have such amenities. Rice and beans are the staples of the Costa Rican diet and are generally served at every meal. Other traditional fare includes fried plantains, eggs, tortillas, and fresh and fabulous tropical fruits. Although host families will provide most meals, volunteers may also eat some meals at the school cafeteria with fellow teachers, or at soda (a small restaurant) in town. Of course, coffee is readily available in Costa Rica!

The host families are chosen by the WorldTeach Field Staff and take part because they enjoy the cultural exchange of hosting a volunteer, many of which have been host families for several years. 

View current Costa Rica year long placements. Please note that placements vary from year to year, depending on school and regional needs.

###### The Costs
The cost of the Costa Rica year long program is $4,590. This includes pre-departure information and preparation, supplemental overseas health and emergency evacuation insurance, 3-week long in-country orientation, transportation to your site, meals and housing during orientation and throughout your teaching service, and 24-hour field support. 

WorldTeach Costa Rica volunteers receive a monthly stipend directly from the Ministry of Education once they begin teaching of approximately $100 per month.  This stipend is more than ample to cover the costs of supplemental food, local travel and utilities.  Each host family receives a monthly amount to cover the costs of room and board (3 meals a day) for their volunteer.

Many volunteers are able to successfully fundraise all or a significant portion of their volunteer commitment. Please refer to our fundraising guide for more information about fundraising possibilities.

#### Summer Program

##### Quick Facts

* Departs late May 2016
* Volunteer commitment: 3 months
* Volunteer cost: $3,990
    * Why do you pay, and what does it cover?
* Applications due: April 15, 2016

APPLY NOW!

* Prep for planning a community project, in coordination with community members
* Number of volunteers each year: approximately 20
* Students: grades 1st through 6th
* Teaching: English (and in limited bilingual placements, math and science)

###### Your Role as a Volunteer
WorldTeach works with the Costa Rican Ministry of Education to place volunteers in schools where students would otherwise go without English language instruction. You and your fellow volunteers will be placed in primary schools throughout the country, working with students between the grades of 1-6. You will give your students the opportunity to learn conversational English and basic grammar. Student love any opportunity to weave they lyrics of a cheesy American pop song into their knowledge of English grammar. Class sizes will vary, ranging from groups as small as 5 up to classrooms of 30 students. As one of the few foreigners passing through the pueblo, you have the opportunity to become a valuable member of your community as a dedicated teacher during the day, and practicing your Spanish over cafecitos with neighbors in the afternoon.

As a volunteer, you will live with two different host families over the course of the summer. Your first will help you adjust to Costa Rica as you spend your initial days in Orosi for Orientation, and your second family in your placement town will take you in and teach you everything Tico for the duration of your time in Costa Rica. WorldTeach has long-standing relationships with many host families who are excited to receive a volunteer year after year. Not only will they provide you with a furnished room and meals, but this is a wonderful opportunity for you to fine tune those conversational Spanish skills. You may be surprised by how close you become with your host family over the course of the summer. Volunteers often stay in contact with their Costa Rican families after they leave, and some have even gone back for a visit!

###### Explore Costa Rica + Mid-Service Conference
For two weeks in July, Costa Rican schools will be closed to celebrate Quince Dias. WorldTeach uses this a time to bring you all back together for a two day Mid-Service conference. This is a great opportunity to learn about the experience of your cohort, revisit some of the teacher training sessions from Orientation, and spend time with the friends you made in the beginning of the summer. This two week break will begin with your two-day Mid-Service conference, allowing you some time for reflection on your experience thus far, while nestled in a quaint town outside the larger coastal city of Manuel Antonio. You will then travel the remaining distance to the coast and spend the rest of the week in Manuel Antonio. There you will have the opportunity to picnic in one of the country’s most popular national parks, zip line through the jungle, or simply relax on the beaches of this tropical paradise. In 2011, Manuel Antonio was voted one of the World’s Top 12 Most Beautiful Beaches and you will experience its beauty firsthand!

The second week of the Quince Dias break, you will travel back to your site to undertake your community project. The community project is discussed at great length during Orientation, and you can use the first few weeks at your site to listen and get the pulse on what kind of activity would benefit your students and community. We don’t doubt you will be able to find something that works with the need of your community but also fits with your skills and knowledge as a volunteer! In the past, community projects have included week-long soccer camps, soccer tournaments, English camp and the painting of a local church. This past summer, one volunteer made a movie with all of her students and fellow teachers, with a script that was entirely in English!

###### The Costs
The cost of the Costa Rica Summer program is $3,990. This covers pre-departure information and preparation, supplemental overseas medical and emergency evacuation insurance, one week in-country orientation as well as a mid-service and end-of-service conference, a small stipend to cover teaching-related expenses, 24-hour field staff support, room and board, and alumni support.

Many volunteers are able to successfully fundraise all or a significant portion of their volunteer commitment. Please refer to our fundraising webpage for more information about fundraising possibilities.

#### Cost Rica Country Info
Rich in ecological diversity and known for its hospitality, Costa Rica has become a favorite vacation spot for American and European travelers over the past two decades. About the size of West Virginia and with a population of roughly four million, Costa Rica has a wealth of natural resources. Its distinctive microclimates feature beautiful beaches, active volcanoes, rainforests filled with monkeys and colorful birds, the hot "cowboy country" of Guanacaste, and more. Additionally, it is also regarded as one of the most peaceful countries in Central America. Costa Rica does not maintain a standing army, and one of its presidents, Oscar Arias, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987. The philosophy of the country can be summed up in the catch phrase "pura vida," ("pure life") which tourists find emblazoned on mugs and t-shirts throughout the country.

Costa Ricans take pride in the high educational level of the country. Free and obligatory elementary school, provided for in the country’s constitution, has led to a high literacy rate among adults. The country boasts a 96% literacy rate and has recently implemented new educational schemes designed to extend opportunities for learning to all its citizens. Students who wish to continue their post-secondary education can choose among four different state-funded universities.

Although Costa Rica dawns over 1,000 miles of coastline, most volunteer placements are in rural inland communities. Volunteers are placed individually as the sole volunteer in their town. While there is no "typical placement" in Costa Rica, most placements have some combination of a plaza (a grassy area about the size of a soccer field), a church, a school and a pulpería (small convenience store). Communication is primarily done through landline phones however cell phone use and reception is increasing daily.
However, what these communities lack in amenities, they make up for with a tremendous amount of heart and soul. Each volunteer is placed with a host family during their service who inevitably become more than just hosts, but true familia.

>I think I have learned to slow down. Life here just moves at a different pace and I have learned that you do not have to be connected to the internet, cell phone or the TV to listen and learn. Life moves at a different pace here and all of the things that have seemed so important in the past matter so very little.
*Meryl Greenblatt, Costa Rica 2010*

###### UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR COSTA RICA VOLUNTEERS
**Isolation**: Most placements in Costa Rica are quite spread out and can be several hours from a big city. Some also have very limited bus service, so it can be hard to get out of town or see another volunteer. Feelings of isolation are common, especially in the adjustment phase when volunteers are still learning the language and meeting people in the community. Costa Ricans are very welcoming and most volunteers report truly feeling like a part of the community by the end of their service, but it takes time, patience, and the courage to put yourself out there on the part of the volunteer.

**Family**: All Costa Rica volunteers live with host families, which contribute to the sentiment that volunteers are truly part of the community. Living with a host family can be a very rewarding experience. Families range from grandparents with grown children, to couples with school aged children, to single mothers. As volunteers are certainly, independent individuals (as proven by their choice to embark upon international service), there are many challenges posed to volunteers as they adapt to living in the home of someone else and navigating through cultural norms that may translate into less privacy.

**Chisme**: Placements in Costa Rica are in extremely small towns, usually consisting of about 150-200 people. Most members of the community are related and have lived in the same community for their whole lives, many for generations. Most women pass the time in the home and thus, gossip is common. The new volunteer will more than likely be the focus of gossip and no topic is off the table. Volunteers have found that they are talked about for who they spend their time with, their teaching techniques, and even their weight. The validity of what is said is typically not scrutinized, either. Usually not used maliciously, this type of gossip is a part of daily life in rural Costa Rica.

**Pura Vida**: The Costa Rican saying, meaning “Pure Life,” signifies the beauty and tranquility that defines the country. However, the “take things as they come” mentality can also be very frustrating for volunteers, with class being cancelled often, sometimes without notice, unreliable schedules, and struggling to get anything done on time. The laid back lifestyle is very different from the fast-paced, connected lifestyle to which most volunteers are accustomed.
