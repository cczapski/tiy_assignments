As a volunteer, you are:
    * Between the ages of 18 and 75 at the time of departure
    * Committing to 3 month or year-long durations (and holding a bachelor's degree for year-long programs)
    * Selecting where out of the 17 countries you'd like to teach
    * Responsible for *some* program costs

We believe research is everything. Let's take a deeper dive!
